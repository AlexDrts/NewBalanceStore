                    <p><strong>Late, Lost, Damaged in Transit, or Wrong Item Received</strong></p>
                    <p>Please allow up to 48 hours after tracking shows “delivered,” as some packages may arrive later or be left in mailrooms, building offices, or with neighbors. Still missing your order or received the wrong item(s)? <Link to="/help">Report a delivery issue.</Link></p>
                    <p><strong>Missing Items</strong></p>
                    <p>Your shipment may be split if some products were unavailable. Remaining items will ship as soon as they’re in stock. You can track your order in <Link to={accountLink}>order history</Link>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Freight Forwarding</strong></p>
                    <p>If you use a freight forwarding company, New Balance is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged packages. Orders delivered to a freight forwarder are considered fulfilled and are at your own risk.</p>

            answer: (
                <p>Most orders can be canceled within one hour of placement by inputting your order status information above and click on "Track Order." Then click on the "Cancel Order" button displaying under your items for your order. If the cancel button is greyed out and states the cancellation period has expired, it's too late to cancel. But don't worry, you can request a return label <Link to="/returns">here</Link>.</p>
