                    The below information is available for those with patented product ideas, designs, or inventions. If you have a general suggestion for us regarding products you would like us to offer (for example, bringing back discontinued models, adding activity-specific shoes, etc.), improvements to our current products (for example, new colors, additional widths, etc.), or would like assistance with other issues such as orders or product recommendations, please email us <Link to="/help" onClick={() => window.scrollTo(0, 0)}>here</Link>. We look forward to hearing your suggestions and assisting you in any way we can!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for your interest in our evaluation procedures for externally submitted inventions and design ideas. As a company, we are, in principle, very happy to evaluate ideas against our specific business requirements, subject to the following conditions:
                </p>

                {CONDITIONS.map((text, index) => (
                    <p key={text}>{index + 1}. {text}</p>
                ))}

                <p>
                    General suggestions about the products we offer, improvements you would like to see, and other feedback or thoughts you would like to share with us should be submitted <Link to="/help" onClick={() => window.scrollTo(0, 0)}>here</Link>. If you feel your patented design or idea satisfies the above conditions, please download the External Submission Form provided below and submit it, with any related materials appended thereto, by email or mail to the appropriate address provided on the Form:
                </p>

                <a href="#" className={styles.pdfLink} onClick={(event) => event.preventDefault()}>

                </a>

                <p>
                    Please note that decision time regarding evaluation of submissions can vary from as little as a few weeks to several months. Although we consider every submission that we receive which is sent according to the above conditions, due to the high volume of submissions we unfortunately cannot respond personally to each submission.
